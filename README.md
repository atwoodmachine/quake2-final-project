Hello, and welcome to my Quake 2 mod.
<br>
This mod is inspired by the roguelike game "Ziggurat". In this mod, several new mechanics have been added to Quake 2 and a lot of the fundamental assumptions about the game have been shaken up!
<br>
New mechanic: experience and leveling
<br>
You gain experience as you defeat enemies in the game. When you get 5 experience points, you level up, increasing your health maximum.
<br>
Spells
<br>
Your weapons have become unstable spells!
Your blaster fires 3 shots.
Your shotgun fires wildly in all directions.
Your super shotgun causes you to self immolate, damaging you and enemies around you.
Your machine gun has become a beam of eldritch energy.
Your chaingun will grant you invulnerability, the effect lasting longer the longer you cast it.
Your grenade launcher summons an orb of power that stays in place and fires lasers at enemies.
Your rocket launcher casts dancing lights in its wake.
Your hyperblaster has been loaded with fragmentation grenades. 
Your railgun fires beams in a cone.
Your BFG now heals you up to your hitpoint maximum.
Your grenades are now cluster bombs.
