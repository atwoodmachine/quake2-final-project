Hello, and welcome to my Quake 2 mod.

This mod is inspired by the roguelike game "Ziggurat". In this mod, several new mechanics have been added to Quake 2 and a lot of the fundamental assumptions about the game have been shaken up!

### New mechanic: experience and leveling

You gain experience as you defeat enemies in the game. When you get 5 experience points, you level up, increasing your health maximum.

### Spells

Your weapons have become unstable spells!
- Your blaster fires 3 shots.
- Your shotgun fires wildly in all directions.
- Your super shotgun causes you to self immolate, damaging you and enemies around you.
- Your machine gun has become a beam of eldritch energy.
- Your chaingun will grant you invulnerability, the effect lasting longer the longer you cast it.
- Your grenade launcher summons an orb of power that stays in place and fires lasers at enemies.
- Your rocket launcher casts dancing lights in its wake.
- Your hyperblaster has been loaded with fragmentation grenades. 
- Your railgun fires beams in a cone.
- Your BFG now heals you up to your hitpoint maximum.
- Your grenades are now cluster bombs.

### Altars

In secret areas around the map, you can find hidden shrines to the old gods that may bless you in exchange for an offering of a fraction of your health, or of a fraction of the mana of your currently held weapon. Once a sacrifice is made, you cannot make another sacrifice of the same type until you find a new shrine.

Use the j key to sacrifice health, and the k key to sacrifice mana. Remember you sacrifice the mana of the weapon you're currenly holding.

### Perks

When you satisfy the gods, you gain a boon. There are five boons in the game:

- Double experience: You gain twice the experience when you defeat an enemy.
- Health regeneration: Your health regenerates over time.
- Blaster upgrade: your blaster becomes a highly precise, highly damaging spell.
- Railgun upgrade: Your railgun fires more beams in its cone of effect.
- Health upgrade: Your maximum health increases and you are healed to full.

### Modifiers

To shake up the game a little, you will be afflicted with a random modifier upon entering a level. These modifiers may have beneficial or deleterious effects. I'll keep these modifiers a surprise for now, but they are detailed in the "testing" section below. 

### Testing
You may use the console command "shrine" to allow yourself to make health and mana sacrifices.<br>
If you want to see all the possible perks, use the following console commands:
- "regen" for health regeneration
- "doubleXP" for increased experience gains
- "upgradePistol" to upgrade the blaster
- "upgradeRailgun" to upgrade the railgun
- "healthUp" to upgrade your health and heal up

You may also see every modifier in the game using the following commands:
- "halfHealth" to instantly drop you to half your current health total
- "wild" to cause your blaster to fire random shots
- "instakill" to give your blaster enough damage to instakill foes
- "leech" to grant you health upon defeating foes
- "ammoDump" to increase your ammo consumption
